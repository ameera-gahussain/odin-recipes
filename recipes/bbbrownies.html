    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a great little recipe for easy, fail-safe, gloriously gooey chocolate brownies</p>
    <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200 g quality dark chocolate (70%)</li>
            <li>250 g unsalted butter</li>
            <li>75 g dried sour cherries , optional</li>
            <li>50 g chopped nuts , optional</li>
            <li>80 g quality cocoa powder</li>
            <li>65 g plain flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>360 g caster sugar</li>
            <li>4 large free-range eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Line a 24cm square baking tin with greaseproof paper.</li>
            <li>Snap the chocolate into a large bowl, add the butter and place over a pan of simmering water, until melted, stirring regularly. Stir through the cherries and nuts (if using).</li>
            <li>Sift the cocoa powder and flour into a separate bowl, add the baking powder and sugar, then mix together.</li>
            <li>Add the dry ingredients to the chocolate, cherry and nut mixture and stir together well. Beat the eggs, then mix in until you have a silky consistency.</li>
            <li>Pour the brownie mix into the baking tin, and place in the oven for around 25 minutes. You don’t want to overcook them so, unlike cakes, you don’t want a skewer to come out clean – the brownies should be slightly springy on the outside but
                still gooey in the middle.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool in the tray, then carefully transfer to a large chopping board and cut into chunky squares. Delicious served with a dollop of crème fraîche or yoghurt mixed with some orange zest.</li>
        </ol>
