    <p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound spicy Italian sausage, casing removed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, minced</li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3½ cups tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>14½ ounces dry penne pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage in a Dutch oven over medium heat until browned, about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in parsley and cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in white wine and cook until the wine has nearly evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in heavy cream, increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Stir in marinara sauce and water and return to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer sauce for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne, and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain</li>
            <li>Combine pasta and sauce; remove from heat, cover and let sit for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve pasta and sauce topped with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.</li>
